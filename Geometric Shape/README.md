# Geometry Shape in Python3 #

## Description: ##

In geometry different types of shapes are existing. And all of them can be represented as mathmatical law.
Such as triangle,square etc.

## Program ##

* In this program different types of shapes were created by taking input parameter "n" as number of line :

  ``` n = Number of line in this object shape ```
  ``` 
    Example for crown:
    n=5 
  ```
  ![A Crown ](Crown.png)
    
 * This problem is solved for :
  * Command Line Print [Shape](shape.ipynb)
    * Triangle
    * Right triangle
    * Square
    * Rectangle
    * Crown
  * Graphical Plot [Advanced Shape](advanced_shape.ipynb):
    * Rectangle
    * Circle
